## **Problem Statement**

The growing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has increased the demand for a reliable and well-distributed network of EV charging stations. However, many charging network operators and stakeholders face challenges in managing and optimizing their infrastructure. Key issues include:

1. **Operational Reliability**: Ensuring that charging stations are consistently operational and minimizing downtime due to maintenance issues or technical faults.
2. **Accessibility**: Providing sufficient 24/7 accessible stations to meet the needs of all users, especially during off-peak hours or in high-traffic areas.
3. **Data Accuracy**: Keeping information about station status, availability, and connector types up to date, as outdated data can lead to poor user experiences and lower usage rates.
4. **Infrastructure Gaps**: Identifying areas with insufficient coverage of fast chargers or public stations, which can limit the network’s growth and user satisfaction.
5. **Scalability**: Managing the rapid growth of charging infrastructure while maintaining high performance and availability, especially as new stations are added.

This project addresses these challenges by building an automated, scalable data pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes EV charging station data. The solution provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual insights that help stakeholders monitor station performance, optimize infrastructure, and make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and support network expansion.

## Business Objective
*As the demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) continues to rise, the availability and accessibility of reliable EV charging infrastructure are critical for both EV owners and charging network operators. This project aims to create a comprehensive data pipeline and analysis solution that provides valuable insights into the performance, accessibility, and growth of EV charging stations. By leveraging Python, AWS, SQL, and Tableau, we build an automated, scalable system that enables stakeholders to monitor charging station operations, optimize infrastructure, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the user experience.*

## Data Sources
- **EV Charging Data**: CSV file with details on charging station locations, status, availability, and types of connectors.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Data ingestion, processing, and transformation.
- **AWS S3**: Storage for raw data files.
- **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Relational database for structured data storage.
- **SQL**: Data analysis and KPI calculations.
- **Tableau**: Visualization and dashboard creation.
- **AWS Lambda**: Automation of data ingestion and updates.

## Project Architecture
*Provide a high-level diagram or description of the project pipeline:*

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Station Operational Rate**: Percentage of stations that are operational.
- **Fast Charging Availability**: Ratio of stations with fast chargers.
- **24/7 Accessibility Rate**: Percentage of stations available 24/7.
- **Public vs. Private Station Availability**: Ratio of public to private stations.
- **Average Connector Diversity**: Average number of connector types per station.

## Installation and Setup
